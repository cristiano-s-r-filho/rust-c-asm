## Overview

This project, developed for a Computer Architecture course, explores the critical aspects of low-level programming and interoperability between Rust, C, and Assembly languages. It focuses on understanding how different programming paradigms interact at the machine level, with a particular emphasis on performance optimization and efficient resource management. The insights gained from this project are directly applicable to understanding system vulnerabilities and developing robust, high-performance software. All was done trhough an attempted implementation of a simulation of Intel's x86 instruction available to the 8086 chipset. Simple, but very fullfilling.

## Key Features & Learning Outcomes

*   **Low-Level System Understanding:** Gained deep insights into memory management, CPU architecture, and direct hardware interaction, which are foundational for identifying and mitigating security loopholes.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Explored techniques for optimizing code execution by leveraging Assembly for critical sections, directly contributing to the 'Optimization' and 'Efficiency' aspects sought by Bending Spoons.
*   **Interoperability:** Demonstrated the ability to integrate code written in different languages, a crucial skill for working with diverse systems and legacy codebases in a security context (e.g., integrating security modules).
*   **Debugging and Problem Solving:** Enhanced debugging skills by working with complex low-level interactions, directly relevant to 'Debugging' and 'Reasoning Skills' required for vulnerability testing.

## Technologies Used

*   **Rust:** A modern systems programming language known for its memory safety and performance.
*   **C:** A foundational language for system-level programming and operating systems.
*   **Assembly:** For direct CPU instruction control and fine-grained optimization.
*   **Makefile:** For managing the build process and dependencies. (Generated by Cargo)

## Future Applications

The knowledge acquired from this project forms a strong basis for understanding how software interacts with hardware, which is critical for advanced cybersecurity roles, including vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering, and developing secure operating systems components. I aim to apply these insights to contribute to robust security strategies and tech implementations.
